# SecondSurface

## Overview

This project consists of a series of interconnected forms developed within a structured solution. The code is organized to support both client and server functionalities, leveraging an MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure for efficient and organized development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply open the `.sln` file using Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE). This solution file links all components, allowing you to navigate between forms, MVC files, and other resources seamlessly.


### Project Structure

The project is divided into several sections:

1. **Forms**:
   - Multiple forms are included, each designed to handle specific aspects of the application's functionality.
   - These forms are connected and work together to provide a cohesive user experience.

2. **Solution_items**:
   - This folder contains MVC files essential for the applicationâ€™s logic, including:
     - **Models**: Define the data structures and business logic.
     - **Views**: Present data to the user and accept user input.
     - **Controllers**: Handle user input, interact with models, and render the appropriate view.

3. **Client**:
   - This section includes client-side code and resources. It may contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other assets as required by the application.

4. **Server**:
   - This section contains server-side code, handling data processing, database interactions, and any other server-related functionality.
   - Files here are structured to support robust server operations, including data retrieval and processing.

## Running the Project

1. **Open the `.sln` File**:
   - Open the solution file (.sln) to load all project files into your development environment.
2. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the solution to compile all components.
   - Run the project to start the application and navigate between forms, as well as client-server interactions.

## Dependencies

Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are installed. You may need to restore packages if prompted by your IDE.
